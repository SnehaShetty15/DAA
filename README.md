** **Brute Force Techniques**

ðŸ”¸ Search and Sort
Description: Basic implementations like Linear Search, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort.

Approach: Check all possibilities without optimization.

Use Case: Simple datasets, teaching basics of algorithm design.



** **Divide and Conquer**

ðŸ”¸ Merge Sort
Description: Recursively splits the array, sorts, and merges.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Use Case: Efficient stable sorting of large datasets.

ðŸ”¸ Quick Sort
Description: Picks a pivot, partitions, then recursively sorts.

Time Complexity: Average O(n log n), Worst O(nÂ²)

Use Case: Fast in-place sorting, often used in libraries.



** **Greedy Techniques**

ðŸ”¸ Water Supply Network
Description: Build cost-effective water distribution using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

Algorithm: Kruskalâ€™s or Primâ€™s Algorithm

Use Case: Infrastructure planning with minimal pipe cost.

ðŸ”¸ Optimal Route Network
Description: Connect points with minimal total cost using MST.

Use Case: Network design (electric grids, road systems).



** **Shortest Path Algorithms**

ðŸ”¸ Optimal Road Routes (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm)
Description: Finds the shortest path from a source to all vertices.

Technique: Greedy

Use Case: GPS navigation, network routing.

ðŸ”¸ Metropolitan Subway System Optimization (Floyd-Warshall)
Description: All-pairs shortest path algorithm.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ³)

Use Case: Planning efficient routes in a fully connected transit system.



** **Optimization and Dynamic Programming**

ðŸ”¸ Optimal Product Selection (Knapsack Problem)
Description: Select items with max value under weight/space constraint.

Approach: 0/1 Knapsack (DP), Fractional Knapsack (Greedy)

Use Case: Shelf space optimization, budget planning.

ðŸ”¸ Sum of Subsets
Description: Find subsets of a set that sum to a specific value.

Approach: Backtracking, Dynamic Programming

Use Case: Combinatorial optimization, subset selection problems.
